This repository contains a framework for **uncertainty prediction** of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flows around airfoils using **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**. It features code for generating a dataset evaluating the simulation uncertainty induced by simulation parameters, and training code for diffusion models, in addition to baselines using **Bayesian neural networks (BNNs)** and **heteroscedastic uncertainty models**.

***Abstract:*** Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neura networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperformthe other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantageof providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions.

### Datasets and Pre-trained Models

The full training data set is available for download at [here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1731896). In this repository, we also provide a reduced version of our dataset corresponding to the single-parameter test in our manuscript. For more details, please see `\datasets\1_parameter` and `process_dataset.ipynb`. You can also use `generate_dataset.ipynb` to generate this dataset.

The pre-trained network weights can be found in `pre_trained` folder, where you can find the weights trained with different random seeds and the corresponding network configuration. You can refer to `sample.ipynb` to see the details on how to use them.

Please let us know if you find anything doesn't work in the repository.
